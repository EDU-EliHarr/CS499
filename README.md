## Key Skills and Experiences  

### 1. **Collaborating in a Team Environment**  
Collaboration is critical in any professional setting, and my coursework emphasized the importance of teamwork. Through projects like the **Mass Tracker App**, I experienced the dynamic process of working with product owners, understanding requirements, and integrating feedback to deliver high-quality software.  

- **Example:** In the software engineering capstone, I refactored tightly coupled code into an MVVM architecture. This approach not only improved modularity but also made the codebase easier for team members to understand and contribute to.  
- **Reflection:** This experience solidified my ability to break down tasks, delegate responsibilities, and ensure smooth communication across functional teams.  

### 2. **Communicating with Stakeholders**  
Effective communication bridges the gap between technical solutions and business goals. My projects often required explaining complex concepts in simple terms to stakeholders with varying technical expertise.  

- **Example:** While implementing backup and restore functionality in the Mass Tracker App, I documented the feature thoroughly and provided stakeholders with clear instructions on its use.  
- **Reflection:** These skills ensure that my solutions align with organizational needs while maintaining clarity and transparency.  

### 3. **Data Structures and Algorithms**  
A strong foundation in data structures and algorithms is essential for crafting efficient and scalable solutions. This knowledge allowed me to enhance the Mass Tracker App by replacing `ArrayList` with `HashMap` for efficient lookups and implementing a sorting algorithm to handle mass logs.  

- **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Searching for the nearest log based on date or mass.  
  - Implementing pagination for a better user experience.  
  - Sorting data dynamically by date or mass in ascending or descending order.  
- **Impact:** These enhancements improved the application's performance and usability, aligning it with industry best practices.  

### 4. **Software Engineering and Database Design**  
The backbone of any reliable application is a robust software architecture and database design. Throughout the program, I honed my ability to create scalable, maintainable, and secure systems.  

- **Example:**  
  - Refactored the Mass Tracker App using the MVVM architecture to separate concerns and enhance testability.  
  - Indexed database tables to improve query performance.  
  - Added constraints to enforce data integrity and implemented a backup/restore mechanism for reliability.  
- **Reflection:** These skills ensure my solutions are both technically sound and adaptable for future growth.  

### 5. **Security**  
Developing a security mindset is essential in todayâ€™s software landscape. My projects emphasized identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities during both the design and implementation phases.  

- **Example:** By centralizing data access in the repository layer of the Mass Tracker App, I ensured that all database operations could be consistently validated for security risks. Constraints like `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` were added to enforce data integrity.  
- **Reflection:** These practices demonstrate my commitment to safeguarding data and delivering secure applications.
